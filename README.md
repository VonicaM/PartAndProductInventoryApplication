# PartAndProductInventoryApplication
An old college assignment meant to demonstrate my ability with Java, and to create GUI applications. This software serves as an outline for an application that would be used to store, create, and modify records for parts and products in a business's inventory.

This application was created with Java using the Apache Netbeans IDE, as well as the SceneBuilder application, for the design of the forms. To run the application on Windows, you will need to go into the dist folder and run the Software1Assignment.bat file. Doing so will run the necessary console commands to connect the Software1Assignment.jar file with the javafx library, both also contained in the same dist folder. The jar file will then begin executing, and you will be able to interact with the application through its GUI.

If you wish to see the code itself, the project can be opened in the Apache Netbeans IDE to view it directly. The various FXML files can also be opened up in SceneBuilder, to get a look at them as well.
